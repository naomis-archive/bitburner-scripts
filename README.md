# BitBurner Scripts

BitBurner is an idle game where you play as a hacker, writing real code in JavaScript to "hack" servers and earn money. With your code, you can automate almost everything in the game.

This repository is a collection of scripts that I have written for the game.

## Live Version

These scripts are for use within the game and are not live.

## Usage

These scripts should be copied into files with the same name in your `~` directory within the game. Note that the `modules` folder cannot be created with `mkdir`, so you would need to `nano modules/calculate-threads.js` to create that file.

## Disclaimer

BitBurner is a FICTIONAL game and these are FICTIONAL scripts. Nothing in this repository is intended to endorse or facilitate actual hacking, and the authors of these scripts do not condone criminal behaviour.
